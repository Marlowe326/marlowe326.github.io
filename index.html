My name is Marlowe and this is my website. Each tab has a specific function. 

## Memories
These are pictures and random memories I want to preserve. With an already diminishing memory at the age of 21, it is important I note down any memory I want to cherish.
## Logs
A bid to be more open and to learn how to verbalise my thoughts. Basically, shitposting.
## Skills
Skills I have developed. Whether skills I have learnt or skills I am learning and having an area I can refer to.
## Contacts
I don't need to explain this one.
## Socials
Subscribe to my youtube.
